# BlackjackGame
A Blackjack game made by Python. Not a GUI version. 
Card game whose object is to be dealt cards having a higher count than those of the dealer, up to but not exceeding 21. The dealer may use a single deck of 52 cards or two or more decks from a holder called a shoe. Aces count as 1 or 11, and face cards as 10.
In my version, I have taken care of probability as well.
